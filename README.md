# Zinc Subgraph

[Zinc](https://zinc.work/) is a work based identity & reputation system that allow companies to become more efficient
at hiring and allow job applicants to own their work data. Zinc uses Ethereum based identity contracts to store proofs
of information collected during the hiring process. So workers donâ€™t have to repeat assessments and checks throughout 
their career.
